Anaconda Python packages include pandas, numpy, sqlite, jupyter, bash, and other kernels.

Frontend and Backend . Fill in the blanks and add any extra notes . Fetching . The Basics . Fetching means getting data from somewhere else, like a website or database. | . JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to fetch data from a website or database. . When you fetch data with JavaScript, you first need to tell it where to get the data from. This is called the URL. | Once you know the URL, you can use JavaScript to go and get the data from that URL. | When the data comes back, it&#39;s usually in a format like text or JSON. This means that you might need to do some additional work to turn the data into something that your website or application can use. | Once you have the data, you can use JavaScript to display it on your website or application. You can put it in a table, show it on a map, or do anything else you can think of. | . . About Fetching . Method . The fetching methods are in line with the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and list as follows: . &quot;GET&quot;: Probably the most common method you would use, which is in line with &quot;read&quot;. It essentially &quot;gets&quot; the information from the API and brings it to the frontend where you are able to display it and read it. | &quot;POST&quot;: Lines up with &quot;create&quot; and adds a resource to the API. You will probably mostly be using this with your own API or if a website adds your input to an API. | &quot;PUT&quot; and &quot;PATCH&quot;: Essentially the &quot;update&quot; for API. Use &quot;PUT&quot; if you want to change the whole resource, or &quot;PATCH&quot; if you want to change just one part of a resource. | &quot;DELETE&quot;: Exactly how it sounds, deletes a resource from the API | . Popcorn Hacks: . What method should I use if I want to display some of the data stored in the backend? | What method would I use if something in the data is misspelled and I want to fix it real quick? | What method should I use if I want to add a new entry to the data? | . Filtering Data . If we want to display API data, we are going to have to filter what we want to display for multiple reasons These include making sure that the user only sees information they need to see, and not anything else | Also we need to present the information in a readable format instead of just seeing the raw data | . | . The below code segment, is from a previous project. It shows the use of a url being fetched, and the JavaScript fetch() command being implemented. . // prepare fetch urls // const url = &quot;https://ssjn.nighthawkcodescrums.gq/api/song&quot;; const url = &quot;https://ssjncpt.duckdns.org/api/song&quot;; const sad_url = url + &quot;/sad/&quot;; // sad category const happy_url = url + &quot;/happy/&quot;; // happy category const rage_url = url + &quot;/rage/&quot;; // rage category const indian_url = url + &quot;/indian/&quot;; // indian category // prepare fetch GET options const options = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;omit&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39; // &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#39;, }, }; // prepare fetch PUT options, clones with JS Spread Operator (...) const put_options = {...options, method: &#39;PUT&#39;}; // clones and replaces method // fetch the API fetch(url, options) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { error(&#39;GET API response failure: &#39; + response.status); return; } // valid response will have JSON data . Third Party APIs . 3rd Party APIs: APIs provided by other developers for public use. . Programmers can use the content of these APIs to create new functionalities for their programs, or they can also simply take advantage of the data of the API for different uses. . Ex: A developed can use Google Account login to allow users to log in with their google account Ex: Using the content of a weather API to make a weather app . The functionalities of these APIs are usually accessed via JavaScript (usually) as you’ve seen before in your past projects. . 3rd party APIs are located on third party servers. To access them from JavaScript you first need to connect to the API functionality and make it available on your page. . &lt;script src=&quot;https://api.mqcdn.com/sdk/mapquest-js/v1.3.2/mapquest.js&quot; defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://api.mqcdn.com/sdk/mapquest-js/v1.3.2/mapquest.css&quot; /&gt; . Here is an example of accessing the objects available in the library above. . const map = L.mapquest.map(&#39;map&#39;, { center: [53.480759, -2.242631], layers: L.mapquest.tileLayer(&#39;map&#39;), zoom: 12 }); . The process of accessing and using third-party APIs can vary depending on the specific API and the requirements set by the API provider. 3rd party APIs use developer keys to allow developers access to the API functionality, which protects the owner of the API. . L.mapquest.key = &#39;YOUR-API-KEY-HERE&#39;; . Developers must apply to get the key of a certain API, and then include it in their code to be allowed access to the API&#39;s functionality. Some API keys are accessed slightly differently, but the method is similar for the most part. . Hack: You’ve used 3rd party APIs before. Go through some of your previous projects/assignments and explain how you implemented a 3rd party API. Reflect on how using the 3rd party API helped. . Pandas . Python (Request) Fetch . Example with Weather API . What method is being used in these cells? | . import requests url = &quot;https://yahoo-weather5.p.rapidapi.com/weather&quot; querystring = {&quot;location&quot;:&quot;San Diego&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;json&quot;,&quot;u&quot;:&quot;f&quot;} headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;4abcb54450msh7468dfd72294e89p18fbaajsn6d4200063b39&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;yahoo-weather5.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers, params=querystring) print(response.json()) . The fetch worked and we can see all the data, but this is presented in a way that is not very readable. It also has a lot of information we didn&#39;t see. Let&#39;s say I just want to see the projected weather forecasts. . import requests url = &quot;https://yahoo-weather5.p.rapidapi.com/weather&quot; querystring = {&quot;location&quot;:&quot;San Diego&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;json&quot;,&quot;u&quot;:&quot;f&quot;} headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;4abcb54450msh7468dfd72294e89p18fbaajsn6d4200063b39&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;yahoo-weather5.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers, params=querystring) print(&quot;San Diego Weather Forecast:&quot; + &quot; n&quot;) forecast = response.json().get(&quot;forecasts&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(forecast): for key, value in forecast[i].items(): print(&quot; t&quot; + key, value) i += 1 print(&quot; n&quot;) . As we can see, we now can see the data in a much more organized and readable format, and we only see the forecasts, which is what we wanted to see. . Github/Fastpages Setup .

            "content": "Basics of Fetching . Fetching means getting data from somewhere else, like a website or database. | JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to fetch data from a website or database. | When you fetch data with JavaScript, you first need to tell it where to get the data from. This is called the URL. | Once you know the URL, you can use JavaScript to go and get the data from that URL. | When the data comes back, it&#39;s usually in a format like text or JSON. This means that you might need to do some additional work to turn the data into something that your website or application can use. | Once you have the data, you can use JavaScript to display it on your website or application. You can put it in a table, show it on a map, or do anything else you can think of. | . . About Fetching . Method . The fetching methods are in line with the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and list as follows: . &quot;GET&quot;: Probably the most common method you would use, which is in line with &quot;read&quot;. It essentially &quot;gets&quot; the information from the API and brings it to the frontend where you are able to display it and read it. | &quot;POST&quot;: Lines up with &quot;create&quot; and adds a resource to the API. You will probably mostly be using this with your own API or if a website adds your input to an API. | &quot;PUT&quot; and &quot;PATCH&quot;: Essentially the &quot;update&quot; for API. Use &quot;PUT&quot; if you want to change the whole resource, or &quot;PATCH&quot; if you want to change just one part of a resource. | &quot;DELETE&quot;: Exactly how it sounds, deletes a resource from the API | . Popcorn Hacks: . What method should I use if I want to display some of the data stored in the backend? | What method would I use if something in the data is misspelled and I want to fix it real quick? | What method should I use if I want to add a new entry to the data? | . Filtering Data . If we want to display API data, we are going to have to filter what we want to display for multiple reasons These include making sure that the user only sees information they need to see, and not anything else | Also we need to present the information in a readable format instead of just seeing the raw data | . | .
