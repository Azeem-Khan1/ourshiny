Fetching means getting data from somewhere else, like a website or database. | JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to fetch data from a website or database. | When you fetch data with JavaScript, you first need to tell it where to get the data from. This is called the URL. | Once you know the URL, you can use JavaScript to go and get the data from that URL. | When the data comes back, it&#39;s usually in a format like text or JSON. This means that you might need to do some additional work to turn the data into something that your website or application can use. | Once you have the data, you can use JavaScript to display it on your website or application. You can put it in a table, show it on a map, or do anything else you can think of. | . . I will explain the image and probably refine the diagram to be more detailed . In Our Project .
